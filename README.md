# newgoldenhammer website (my first blog/website)

Houses the code for my first (extremely embarassing) website. Static website buit in R with [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) via [](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which is no longer available hosted (although, if you really want to see how embarssing it is, just do it yourself).
