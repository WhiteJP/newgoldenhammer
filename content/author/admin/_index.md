My name is Josh White. I'm an aspiring academic---currently a mere graduate student---living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm interested in Moral Psychology, Political Psychology, Experimental Philosophy and Cognitive Psychology; and how new data analysis techniques and big data can elucidate the perennial questions in these domains. Previously, I worked as a litigation lawyer so I've also got a healthy interest in the theoretical side of the law too ... just not so much the practical side.
