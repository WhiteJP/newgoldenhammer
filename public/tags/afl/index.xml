      <description>In part one of this series, I applied three different models to the 2018 AFL season. In this part, I apply these models to the 2019 AFL fixture to attempt to make some predictions about the standings at the end of the year.
Now Ideally, I would have applied these models to the last 10 (or more) years of AFL data to see which one better predicts results for the upcoming year — but who has time for that — So we are just going to go ahead.</description>

      <description>Recently I was, as I am (unfortunately) rather wont to do, aimlessly watching YouTube videos when I came across these two videos by Numberphile. Here, the authors discuss their attempts at modelling and simulating seasons of the English Premier League.
As an avid AFL fan, and with the upcoming season fast approaching (edit, now underway, carn the cats!), why not try to apply these methods to the AFL season. This post will be the first of a three part series.</description>
