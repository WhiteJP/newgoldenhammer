      <description>Normal and Poisson modelsPreparatory stepsPossion model simulationsNormal model simulationsRankings Model: TanhPostscript: How are my models fairing so far?Parts 1 and 2 of this series made attempts to model, and them simulate, the 2018 and 2019 AFL seasons. These models were extremely simplistic, but were none-the-less interesting.

      <description>The Models: A ReminderPoisson Distributed Team ScoresNormally Distributed team scoresRankings model: tanh2019 ResultsPoisson modelNormal modelTanh modelComparing the three models.In part one of this series, I applied three different models to the 2018 AFL season. In this part, I apply these models to the 2019 AFL fixture to attempt to make some predictions about the standings at the end of the year.</description>

Here, the authors discuss their attempts at modelling and simulating seasons of the English Premier League.</description>
